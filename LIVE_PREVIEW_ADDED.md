# 🎉 Live Component Preview - ADDED!

## What Changed

You asked for the **actual UI component** instead of just code - done! ✅

### NEW: Live Component Preview Modal

When you generate a component now, you'll see:

1. **Split-Screen View:**
   - 👁️ **Left Side:** Live rendered component (actual UI!)
   - 📝 **Right Side:** Source code

2. **Auto-Opens:**
   - Preview automatically opens after generation
   - No need to click anything extra

3. **Interactive Preview:**
   - See the real component styling
   - Buttons, forms, cards - all render live
   - Uses React + Tailwind CSS in sandbox iframe

4. **Gaze Tracking Works:**
   - Your gaze is tracked while viewing preview
   - Collects attention data for optimization
   - AI suggestions based on where you actually look

---

## How to Use It

### Automatic (Recommended)
1. Generate any component
2. Preview opens automatically in 0.5 seconds
3. Look at the live preview
4. Close when done (or generate another)

### Manual
1. See generated component card
2. Click "👁️ View Live" button
3. Preview opens

## Why This Matters for Cal Hacks

### Before:
- Generated code shown as text
- Judges have to imagine what it looks like
- Hard to demo the UX value

### After:
- **Live rendered component** visible immediately
- Judges see the actual UI
- Gaze tracking on live preview is more impressive
- Professional presentation

### Judge Impact:
> "We don't just generate code - we show you the **actual component** and track how users **actually interact with it**. That's the difference."

**Demo Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (much more impressive!)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Preview shows blank white screen"
**Solution:** This means the component code has an error. Check browser console.

### Issue: "Styles not applying"
**Solution:** Tailwind CSS takes a moment to load from CDN. Wait 2 seconds and refresh.

### Issue: "Component not interactive"
**Solution:** Interactive components (with state) work! Try clicking buttons in the preview.

### Issue: "Preview is slow to open"
**Solution:** First load downloads React/Tailwind from CDN. Subsequent previews are instant.
