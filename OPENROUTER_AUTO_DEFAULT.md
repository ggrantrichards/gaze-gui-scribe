# ‚úÖ OpenRouter Auto-Select - Now Default

## üéØ Change Applied

**Default model changed from Gemini 2.5 Flash to OpenRouter Auto**

### **Before:**
```python
model="google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"  # Fixed to Gemini
```

### **After:**
```python
model="openrouter/auto"  # OpenRouter intelligently selects best model
```

---

## ü§ñ What is OpenRouter Auto?

**OpenRouter Auto** (`openrouter/auto`) is OpenRouter's intelligent routing system that:

- üß† **Analyzes your prompt** to understand complexity
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balances cost vs quality** based on the task
- üéØ **Selects the optimal model** automatically
- üîÑ **Adapts dynamically** - might use different models for different sections!

---

## üí° How It Works

### **For Simple Components:**
OpenRouter might select:
- Gemini Flash (fast, free)
- Llama 3.1 70B (fast, free)
- Mixtral (fast, low cost)

### **For Complex Landing Pages:**
OpenRouter might select:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best for UI/UX)
- GPT-4o (reliable, modern)
- Gemini Pro (balanced)

### **The Magic:**
You don't have to choose! OpenRouter figures out what's best for each specific generation request.

---

## üìä Benefits

### **Before (Fixed Model):**
- ‚ùå Same model for all tasks (might be overkill or insufficient)
- ‚ùå Manual switching needed for different quality levels
- ‚ùå Not optimized for cost or speed

### **After (Auto-Select):**
- ‚úÖ Optimal model for each request
- ‚úÖ Automatic quality/cost optimization
- ‚úÖ Better results on complex prompts
- ‚úÖ Faster on simple prompts
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective overall

---

## üß™ What to Expect

### **Console Output:**
```
üì® Received multi-section generation request: build a modern landing page
üèóÔ∏è Generating 7 sections for saas page
‚öôÔ∏è Generating Navigation...
‚úÖ Generated with OpenRouter (Auto-selected model)
‚úÖ Section Navigation generated
‚öôÔ∏è Generating Hero...
‚úÖ Generated with OpenRouter (Auto-selected model)
‚úÖ Section Hero generated
... (continues)
```

### **Which Models Might Be Used:**
OpenRouter will dynamically choose from your available models. Common selections:
- **Navigation bars:** Fast models (Gemini, Llama)
- **Hero sections:** Quality models (Claude, GPT-4)
- **Complex layouts:** Premium models (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4)
- **Simple components:** Free/fast models (Gemini Flash, Mixtral)

---

## üí∞ Cost Implications

### **With Auto-Select:**

**Good News:**
- OpenRouter optimizes for cost efficiency
- Won't use expensive models unnecessarily
- Respects your budget preferences in OpenRouter dashboard

**Typical Cost for 7-Section Landing Page:**
- **Gemini/Llama sections:** $0 (free tier)
- **Claude/GPT-4 sections:** ~$0.05-0.15 per section
- **Total estimate:** $0.10-0.50 per full landing page

**Your $5 free credit = ~10-50 landing pages!**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring OpenRouter Preferences

You can influence which models OpenRouter Auto selects:

### **In OpenRouter Dashboard:**

1. Go to [openrouter.ai/settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings)
2. Set **Model Preferences:**
   - Prefer faster models
   - Prefer cheaper models
   - Prefer highest quality
3. Set **Budget Limits:**
   - Max cost per request
   - Monthly spending limit
4. **Enable/Disable Models:**
   - Block expensive models
   - Prioritize specific models

**OpenRouter Auto respects these preferences!**

## üé¨ For Your Demo

### **Talking Points:**

> "Our platform uses OpenRouter's intelligent routing. Instead of forcing one model for all tasks, OpenRouter analyzes each request and selects the optimal AI‚Äîwhether that's Claude for complex layouts, Gemini for speed, or GPT-4 for reliability. This gives us the best of all worlds: quality, speed, and cost-efficiency."

### **Show Variety:**

Generate multiple sections and point out:
- Fast generation for simple sections
- Higher quality for complex sections
- Automatic optimization without manual intervention

### **Emphasize Intelligence:**

> "Watch how seamlessly the system adapts. For this navigation bar, it might use a fast model. For this hero section with complex gradients, it automatically upgrades to a premium model. All transparent, all optimized, all automatic."

---

## üîç Monitoring Which Models Are Used

### **OpenRouter Activity Dashboard:**
Visit [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity) to see:
- Which models were actually selected
- Cost breakdown per model
- Performance metrics
- Success rates

**Example Activity Log:**
```
Request 1: openrouter/auto ‚Üí Selected google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp (Navigation)
Request 2: openrouter/auto ‚Üí Selected anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet (Hero)
Request 3: openrouter/auto ‚Üí Selected google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp (Features)
Request 4: openrouter/auto ‚Üí Selected openai/gpt-4o (Pricing)
...
```

**You'll see the variety!**

## üÜò Fallback Behavior

### **If OpenRouter Auto Fails:**

Your system still has robust fallbacks:

1. **OpenRouter Auto** (Primary) ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**
2. **OpenAI GPT-4** (First fallback) - Reliable, high quality
3. **Mock Generation** (Last resort) - Always works, no API needed

**Triple redundancy ensures generation never fails!**

## üéØ Comparison: Auto vs Fixed Model

| Aspect | Gemini Fixed | **Auto-Select** ‚úÖ |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Quality** | Good | Excellent (adapts) |
| **Speed** | Fast | Varies (optimized) |
| **Cost** | Free | Optimized |
| **Flexibility** | None | High |
| **Optimization** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Best For** | Budget-conscious | Best results |

**Auto-Select is perfect for your demo!** Shows sophistication and intelligence.
