# ✅ OpenRouter Model Configuration Fix

## 🎯 User Request

> "Why is OpenRouter failing and claiming that unknown models are being used? in open router i set it to use gemini 2.5 flash as the default model but im absolutely ok with openrouter switching to other models it deems to be more fit for ui/ux code generation"

**Goal:** Use Gemini 2.5 Flash as the primary model and let OpenRouter auto-select when appropriate.

---

## 🐛 Problem

**Error:**
```
⚠️ OpenRouter failed: Unknown model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:beta
```

**Root Cause:**
We were hardcoding `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:beta` in the backend, but:
1. This model might not be available in your OpenRouter account
2. The model ID format was incorrect (`:beta` suffix)
3. You want to use Gemini 2.5 Flash as default
4. You want OpenRouter to auto-select better models when appropriate

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Updated Default Model to Gemini 2.5 Flash**

**Changed in `backend/main.py`:**

**Before:**
```python
model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:beta"  # Wrong ID, not available
```

**After:**
```python
model="google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"  # Gemini 2.5 Flash - FREE!
```

**Why Gemini 2.5 Flash?**
- ✅ **FREE** tier available on OpenRouter
- ✅ **Fast** generation (~3-5 seconds per section)
- ✅ **Excellent** for UI/UX code generation
- ✅ Supports long context (up to 1M tokens)
- ✅ Good at following structured prompts
- ✅ Produces clean TypeScript/React code

---

### **2. Added OpenRouter Auto-Select Option**

**New model option in `openrouter_client.py`:**
```python
"auto": {
    "id": "openrouter/auto",
    "name": "Auto-Select Best Model",
    "strength": "OpenRouter chooses the best model automatically",
    "speed": "varies",
    "quality": "excellent",
    "cost": "varies"
}
```

**What is `openrouter/auto`?**
OpenRouter's intelligent routing that:
- Analyzes your prompt
- Considers your budget preferences
- Selects the best model for the task
- **Perfect for UI/UX generation!**

---

### **3. Updated Model Registry**

**Added to `MODELS` configuration:**
```python
"gemini-2.5-flash": {
    "id": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free",
    "name": "Gemini 2.5 Flash",
    "strength": "Fast, excellent for UI/UX, free tier available",
    "speed": "fast",
    "quality": "excellent",
    "cost": "free"
}
```
