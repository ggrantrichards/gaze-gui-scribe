## Resource Allocation

### Single Developer
- **30 weeks @ 33 hrs/week** = Full-time for 7.5 months
- Realistic timeline: **9 months** (accounting for context switching, meetings, etc.)

### Two Developers
- **15 weeks @ 33 hrs/week each** = 3.75 months
- Realistic timeline: **5 months**

### Three Developers
- **10 weeks @ 33 hrs/week each** = 2.5 months
- Realistic timeline: **3.5 months**

---

## Critical Path

These tasks **must** be completed in order (cannot be parallelized):

1. Setup & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
2. LLM Client (Week 3)
3. Code Generator (Week 5-6)
4. Component Generation Hook (Week 7-8)
5. Builder Workspace (Week 9-10)
6. Live Preview Integration (Week 11-12)

After Week 12, many tasks can be parallelized:
- Gaze analytics can be developed independently
- Design system can be developed independently
- Export/deploy can be developed in parallel with analytics

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks (Very High Complexity)

| Task | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| Streaming AI responses | Complex state management | Start simple (non-streaming), add later |
| WebGL heatmap acceleration | Browser compatibility | Fallback to Canvas 2D |
| A/B testing framework | Scope creep | MVP: Basic comparison, defer advanced features |
| Component library (30+ components) | Time sink | Use shadcn/ui as base, customize |
| Yjs CRDT integration | Steep learning curve | Follow official guides, use y-websocket template |

---

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

Prioritize these for early demos:

1. **Week 4:** Basic button generation from prompt (wow factor)
2. **Week 10:** Split-pane workspace (looks professional)
3. **Week 14:** First working heatmap (unique differentiator)
4. **Week 22:** One-click GitHub export (immediate value)

---

## Optional Features (Can Be Deferred)

- WebGL heatmap acceleration
- Vue/Svelte code generators
- Voice input
- Commenting system
- A/B testing framework
- Netlify/Cloudflare Pages integration
- Custom theme editor
- Mobile gaze tracking
