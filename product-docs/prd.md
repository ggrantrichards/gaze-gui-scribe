# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## ClientSight: AI-Powered Gaze-Driven UI/UX Builder & Analytics Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025  
**Owner:** ClientSight Product Team  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ClientSight is an AI-powered UI/UX builder and analytics platform that combines real-time webcam-based eye-tracking with intelligent design automation. It empowers developers, designers, and UX researchers to understand user attention patterns, receive AI-driven UI improvement suggestions, and iterate on interfaces using natural language commands—all within a unified, privacy-first environment.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
Transform how teams build and optimize digital experiences by revealing *where* users actually look, *why* they engage (or don't), and *how* to fix UI issues instantly—without leaving the browser.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Pain Points

**For Developers:**
- Traditional analytics (clicks, hovers) don't reveal *visual* engagement or attention bottlenecks.
- Iterating on UI changes requires switching between design tools, code editors, and analytics dashboards—slowing velocity.
- No real-time feedback on whether UI changes actually capture user attention.

**For Designers:**
- Guesswork dominates layout, hierarchy, and content placement decisions.
- Heatmaps and session replays show *outcomes*, not the cognitive paths users took to get there.
- Prototyping tools (Figma, Sketch) lack real-world user gaze data for validation.

**For UX Researchers:**
- Lab-based eye-tracking is expensive, time-consuming, and doesn't scale to production environments.
- Difficult to identify *why* users miss CTAs, abandon forms, or overlook key content.
- No actionable, automated recommendations tied directly to gaze behavior.

### Opportunity

Build a unified platform that:
1. Tracks real-time gaze data to understand attention patterns.
2. Detects UI/UX issues based on abnormal dwell time, skipped elements, or poor visual hierarchy.
3. Suggests and implements AI-driven UI improvements via natural language—instantly.
4. Serves as a collaborative builder tool (like Figma, v0, or Bolt.new) but *gaze-informed* and *privacy-first*.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Real-Time Gaze Tracking & Calibration

**Description:**  
Webcam-based eye-tracking using WebGazer.js with a quick 5-point calibration to deliver real-time gaze coordinates overlaid on any web page or app interface.

**Requirements:**
- 5-point calibration completed in <45 seconds.
- Median gaze accuracy ≤80px under standard lighting/webcam conditions.
- Visual gaze cursor overlay showing current point of attention.
- Pause/resume controls for user privacy.

**Success Metrics:**
- 90%+ calibration completion rate.
- <60ms camera-to-gaze-point latency.

---

### 4.2 Attention Heatmaps & Engagement Analytics

**Description:**  
Aggregate gaze data across sessions to generate attention heatmaps, fixation maps, and engagement metrics (dwell time, scanpath, visual return rate) for each UI component.

**Requirements:**
- Real-time heatmap overlay showing high/low attention zones.
- Per-element engagement metrics:
  - **Dwell Time:** Total time eyes spent on element.
  - **First Fixation Time:** How quickly users notice the element.
  - **Visual Return Rate:** How often users re-examine the element.
  - **Skip Rate:** % of users who never looked at the element.
- Export heatmaps and data as PNG/CSV for reporting.

**Success Metrics:**
- Heatmap generation in <2 seconds for sessions up to 1000 elements.
- Data accuracy validated against lab-grade eye-trackers (±15% variance acceptable).

---

### 4.3 AI-Driven UI Issue Detection & Suggestions

**Description:**  
Machine learning models analyze gaze patterns to detect usability problems (e.g., missed CTAs, ignored content, confusing navigation) and automatically suggest fixes.

**Requirements:**
- **Abnormal Dwell Time Detection:**  
  - If users look at a non-interactive element (e.g., plain text, image) for >3 seconds longer than average, flag as potential confusion or mislabeling.
  - Suggest: "Users are staring at this text block—consider turning it into a clickable CTA or clarifying its purpose."

- **Ignored Element Detection:**  
  - If <20% of users fixate on a critical element (e.g., CTA, form field), flag as visibility issue.
  - Suggest: "This button is being ignored. Recommendations: Increase size, change color to high-contrast, or reposition higher in visual hierarchy."

- **Poor Visual Hierarchy:**  
  - Detect when users scan in unexpected order (e.g., skipping headlines, jumping erratically).
  - Suggest: "Users are not following expected reading flow. Consider increasing font size/weight for headers or adjusting layout."

- **Form Abandonment Patterns:**  
  - If users dwell on a form field for >10 seconds without interaction, flag as friction point.
  - Suggest: "Users hesitate at this field—consider adding helper text, placeholder examples, or reducing required fields."

**AI Model:**
- Random forest classifier to distinguish engaged vs. confused gaze behavior.
- Slope analysis to filter false positives (random glances vs. sustained attention).
- Continuous learning from aggregated (anonymized, local) session data.

**Success Metrics:**
- ≥80% accuracy in flagging genuine usability issues (validated via A/B tests).
- Suggestions lead to measurable engagement lift (e.g., +15% CTA clicks, -20% form abandonment).

### 4.4 Natural Language UI Builder & Editor

**Description:**  
Users can lock onto any UI element via gaze and apply changes using conversational commands (e.g., "Make this button blue," "Increase font size to 18px," "Add rounded corners"). Functions as a collaborative design tool similar to Figma Make, v0, or Bolt.new—but driven by gaze + language.

**Requirements:**
- **Element Locking:**  
  - Keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Alt+G / Ctrl+Alt+G) locks the element currently under gaze focus.
  - Visual highlight (border + label) confirms locked element.

- **Natural Language Parser (NLP):**  
  - Support commands for:
    - **Color changes:** "Make background red," "Change text color to #0894b4."
    - **Typography:** "Set font size to 20px," "Make this bold."
    - **Spacing:** "Add padding 16px," "Increase margin by 8."
    - **Borders & Radius:** "Add border 2px solid black," "Set border radius to 12px."
    - **Text content:** "Change text to 'Get Started'."
  - Zod schema validation for all parsed properties.

- **Live Preview & Undo:**  
  - Changes applied instantly with live preview.
  - Full undo/redo stack for rollback.
  - Export final CSS or React/Vue/HTML component code.

- **Collaborative Editing:**

## 8. Open Questions & Risks

### Open Questions
1. Should we support mobile/tablet gaze tracking, or focus solely on desktop?
2. How do we monetize: freemium SaaS, per-seat licensing, or API usage tiers?
3. What level of Figma/Sketch integration is realistic for MVP vs. V2?

### Risks
- **Accuracy Risk:** Webcam-based tracking may not meet enterprise reliability standards.  
  *Mitigation:* Invest in advanced ML models, offer hardware integration path (e.g., Tobii).

- **Privacy Concerns:** Users may distrust webcam-based tools despite local processing.  
  *Mitigation:* Transparent privacy policy, third-party audit, clear opt-in flows.

- **Adoption Friction:** Calibration and setup may deter casual users.  
  *Mitigation:* Streamline onboarding, offer "demo mode" with sample data, improve UX.

- **Competitive Response:** Established tools (Hotjar, Figma, v0) could add similar features.  
  *Mitigation:* Move fast, build defensible AI models, lock in design community early.
