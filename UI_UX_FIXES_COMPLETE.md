## 🖼️ New UI Components

### Progress Indicator
```tsx
{/* Appears during generation */}
<div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-blue-900/30 border border-blue-700 rounded-lg">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
    <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-5 w-5 border-2 border-blue-500 border-t-transparent"></div>
    <div className="flex-1">
      <div className="text-sm font-semibold text-blue-300">
        {generationProgress}
      </div>
      {totalSections > 0 && (
        <div className="text-xs text-blue-400 mt-1">
          Section {currentSectionIndex} of {totalSections}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  </div>
  {/* Progress bar */}
  <div className="w-full bg-blue-950 rounded-full h-2">
    <div 
      className="bg-blue-500 h-2 rounded-full transition-all duration-300"
      style={{ width: `${(currentSectionIndex / totalSections) * 100}%` }}
    ></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🔧 Black Screen Fix

### Diagnosis:
The black screen issue is likely caused by:
1. **Page Builder z-index** conflicting with gaze overlay
2. **Empty canvas** showing before sections render
3. **Backend not running** or returning errors

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. Better Empty State
```tsx
{sections.length === 0 ? (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-white to-slate-50">
    <div className="text-center p-8">
      <div className="text-7xl mb-6 animate-pulse">🎨</div>
      <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-3">Your Canvas Awaits</h3>
      <p className="text-slate-600 text-lg mb-6">Generate your first section to create something amazing!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
) : (
  <PageBuilderCanvas sections={sections} ... />
)}
```

#### 2. Z-Index Fix
- Page Builder: `z-index: 10000`
- Gaze Overlay: `z-index: 9999`
- Ensures Page Builder is always on top

#### 3. Loading States
- Shows "Analyzing your request..." immediately
- Updates as sections are generated
- User knows something is happening

2. Type: **"Create a hero section"**
3. Click **✨ Generate Section**

**✅ You should see:**
- Button changes to "Generating..." with spinner
- Progress panel appears: "Generating component..."
- After ~5-10 seconds: "✅ Component generated!"
- Section appears on canvas

### Test 2: Multi-Section Progress Bar
1. Type: **"Create a modern SaaS landing page"**
2. Click **Generate**

**✅ You should see:**
- Progress panel appears
- Status: "Analyzing your request..."
- Status: "Preparing to generate sections..."
- Status: "Generating sections..."

## 🐛 If You Still See Black Screen

### Check 1: Is Backend Running?
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

Look for:
```
✅ OpenRouter API key found
🎉 All agents ready!
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Check 2: Frontend Console Errors
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red errors
3. Common issues:
   - "Failed to fetch" → Backend not running
   - "Module not found" → Need to restart
   - "500 Internal Server Error" → Backend error

### Check 3: Restart Everything
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend
npm run dev

# Browser: Hard refresh
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R
```

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before (❌ Bad UX):
- Click button → nothing happens visually
- Wait 1-2 minutes in silence
- Only console shows activity
- User doesn't know if it's working
- Black screen confusion

### After (✅ Good UX):
- Click button → immediate feedback
- Button shows "Generating..." with spinner
- Progress panel appears
- Real-time status updates
- Progress bar fills up
- User knows exactly what's happening
- White canvas with helpful empty state

---

## 💡 Cal Hacks Demo Tips

### Show the Loading Experience:
> "Watch the progress indicator - you can see exactly which section is being generated. The AI creates Navigation, then Hero, then Features... Each section appears as it's ready. This transparency helps users understand the process!"

### Highlight the Progress Bar:
> "Unlike other tools that just show a spinning loader, we show you the actual progress. You can see 'Section 3 of 7' with a progress bar. This is especially useful for landing pages with many sections."
