## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (2 minutes):
1. **Start the backend** (should already be running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start the frontend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the feature**:
   - Log in / Complete onboarding
   - Generate a landing page (try: "create a saas landing page")
   - **Look at a button for 2+ seconds**
   - ✅ Suggestion panel should appear!
   - Click "Apply" on a suggestion
   - ✅ Button should update instantly!

### Advanced Test:
- Try custom edits: "make this button blue"
- Test on different elements (buttons, headings, images)
- Generate multiple sections, test across sections
- Dismiss and re-trigger suggestions
