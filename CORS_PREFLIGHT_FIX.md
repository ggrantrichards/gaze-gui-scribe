# CORS Preflight Fix - Complete ✅

## The Problem

The backend was returning `400 Bad Request` for OPTIONS requests (CORS preflight), which prevented the frontend from making POST requests to the API.

```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:53776 - "OPTIONS /api/generate-multi-section-stream HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request
```

## Root Cause

The OPTIONS handlers I initially added were returning simple JSON objects:
```python
@app.options("/api/generate-multi-section-stream")
async def generate_multi_section_stream_options():
    return {"status": "ok"}  # ❌ Missing CORS headers!
```

This didn't include the necessary CORS headers that browsers need to allow the actual POST request.

## The Fix

Updated ALL OPTIONS handlers to return proper `Response` objects with explicit CORS headers:

```python
from fastapi import Response

@app.options("/api/generate-multi-section-stream")
async def generate_multi_section_stream_options():
    return Response(status_code=200, headers={
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
    })
```

## Fixed Endpoints

✅ `/api/generate-multi-section-stream`
✅ `/api/generate-multi-section`
✅ `/api/generate-component`
✅ `/api/export-project`
✅ `/api/optimize-with-gaze`
✅ `/api/generate-suggestions`
✅ `/api/apply-edit`

## Why This Matters

CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests happen automatically when:
1. Frontend makes a POST request to a different origin
2. Browser sends OPTIONS first to check if it's allowed
3. Backend must respond with proper CORS headers
4. Only then does the browser send the actual POST request

Without proper OPTIONS handling:
- ❌ All POST requests fail with CORS errors
- ❌ OpenRouter can't be called
- ❌ AI generation doesn't work
- ❌ Gaze suggestions can't be generated

## Not Related to Firebase

**This issue was NOT caused by Firebase or ports!** 

The backend was running fine on port 8000. Firebase authentication is a separate frontend concern and doesn't affect backend API routes.

## Testing

After the backend restarts, you should see:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:xxxxx - "OPTIONS /api/generate-multi-section-stream HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO: 127.0.0.1:xxxxx - "POST /api/generate-multi-section-stream HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

✅ OPTIONS returns 200 (not 400)
✅ POST request succeeds
✅ OpenRouter works again
✅ AI generation works

## Status: FIXED ✅

Backend has been restarted with proper CORS preflight handling. All API endpoints should now work correctly!
