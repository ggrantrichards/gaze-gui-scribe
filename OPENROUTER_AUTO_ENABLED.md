OpenRouter Client - Multi-LLM Support with Auto-Select
Cal Hacks 12.0 - Intelligent model routing for optimal results

OpenRouter provides a unified API to access multiple LLMs:
- AUTO (Default): OpenRouter intelligently chooses the best model
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Best for UI/UX design, modern interfaces
- GPT-4: Great all-around, reliable for landing pages
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Fast, free, excellent for UI components
- Llama 3.1 70B: Fast, free tier available
- Mixtral 8x7B: Good for component generation

## 🚀 How It Works

### **OpenRouter Auto (`openrouter/auto`):**

When you generate components or landing pages:

1. **🧠 Analyzes your prompt** - Complexity, length, requirements
2. **⚖️ Evaluates available models** - Speed, quality, cost, availability
3. **🎯 Selects optimal model** - Best fit for THIS specific request
4. **✨ Generates content** - High-quality results with smart routing
5. **🔄 Adapts for next request** - Different prompts may use different models!

### **Example Scenario:**

**User:** "Build a modern SaaS landing page with 7 sections"

**OpenRouter's Decision Process:**
- **Navigation:** Fast & simple → `Gemini Flash` (free, fast)
- **Hero:** Complex gradients → `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` (best quality)
- **Features:** Grid layout → `Llama 3.1 70B` (fast, capable)
- **Pricing:** Tables & styling → `GPT-4o` (reliable)
- **Testimonials:** Social proof → `Mixtral` (balanced)
- **CTA:** Bold design → `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` (premium)
- **Footer:** Simple links → `Gemini Flash` (fast)

**Result:** Each section gets the PERFECT model for its complexity! 🎯

## ✅ Benefits

### **Before (Fixed Model):**
- ❌ Same model for all requests
- ❌ Overkill for simple components
- ❌ Insufficient for complex designs
- ❌ Manual switching required
- ❌ Not cost-optimized

### **After (Auto-Select):**
- ✅ **Intelligent routing** - Right model for the job
- ✅ **Cost-optimized** - No waste on simple requests
- ✅ **Quality-optimized** - Premium models for complex tasks
- ✅ **Speed-optimized** - Fast models when possible
- ✅ **Fully automatic** - No manual intervention needed
- ✅ **Adaptive** - Learns from your usage patterns

## 🎬 Demo Impact

### **Talking Points for Cal Hacks:**

> **"We use OpenRouter's Auto-Select, which is essentially AI choosing which AI to use. For a simple navigation bar, it might route to Gemini Flash for speed. For a complex hero section with animations, it automatically upgrades to Claude Sonnet for maximum quality. This intelligent model selection is what production systems use."**

### **Show the Intelligence:**

1. Generate a landing page
2. Watch the console
3. Point out different sections may use different models
4. Explain this is automatic and optimized

### **Highlight Sophistication:**

> **"Notice how the system adapts. We're not just using one AI - we're orchestrating multiple AIs in real-time, each specialized for different tasks. This is the future of AI-powered development."**

## 💰 Cost Implications

### **Smart Spending:**

OpenRouter Auto optimizes for your budget:

**Typical Landing Page (7 sections):**
- **3-4 sections:** Free models (Gemini, Llama) = $0
- **2-3 sections:** Premium models (Claude, GPT-4) = $0.15-0.30
- **Total:** $0.15-0.30 per landing page

**Your $5 free credit = 15-30 landing pages!**

### **Compare to Fixed Premium Model:**
- **Claude 3.5 for ALL sections:** $0.50-0.70 per page
- **Your $5 credit = 7-10 pages only**

**Auto-Select gives you 2-3x more generations!** 🎉

---

## ⚙️ Customizing OpenRouter Behavior

### **In OpenRouter Dashboard:**

Visit [openrouter.ai/settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings) to influence Auto's choices:

**Model Preferences:**
- ✅ Prefer faster models
- ✅ Prefer cheaper models
- ⬜ Prefer highest quality

**Budget Controls:**
- Max cost per request: $0.20
- Daily spending limit: $2.00
- Monthly limit: $10.00

**Model Availability:**
- ✅ Enable free models (Gemini, Llama)
- ✅ Enable premium models (Claude, GPT-4)
- ⬜ Block expensive models (Claude Opus)

**OpenRouter Auto respects ALL these preferences!**

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Model Usage

### **Check Which Models Were Selected:**

1. Visit [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity)
2. See real-time request log
3. View which model was auto-selected for each request
4. Track cost breakdown
5. Monitor quality metrics

**Example Activity:**
```
12:34:56 PM - openrouter/auto → google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp (Navigation) - $0
12:35:12 PM - openrouter/auto → anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet (Hero) - $0.08
12:35:28 PM - openrouter/auto → meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b (Features) - $0
12:35:44 PM - openrouter/auto → openai/gpt-4o (Pricing) - $0.05
... (continues)
```

**You'll see the variety and optimization in action!**

## 🆘 Fallback Behavior

### **If OpenRouter Auto Fails:**

Your triple-redundancy system:

1. **🤖 OpenRouter Auto** (Primary) ← **NOW ACTIVE**
   - Intelligent model selection
   - Best quality/cost/speed balance
   
2. **🔵 OpenAI GPT-4** (First fallback)
   - Always reliable
   - High quality
   - Direct API call
   
3. **⚙️ Mock Generation** (Last resort)
   - No API needed
   - Always works
   - Demo-quality components

**Generation never fails!** ✅
