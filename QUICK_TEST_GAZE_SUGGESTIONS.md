- **Note:** Mock suggestions should still appear even without API key

## Demo Tips 🎬

## Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How does it know what I'm looking at?**
A: WebGazer.js tracks your eyes, we detect dwell on specific DOM elements inside the generated iframes.

**Q: What if I don't have an OpenAI key?**
A: It falls back to mock suggestions - still functional!

**Q: Can I undo changes?**
A: Currently you'd need to re-generate the section. Undo is a future feature.

**Q: Does it work with keyboard/mouse?**
A: The gaze detection requires eye tracking, but once triggered, you use mouse/keyboard to interact.

**Q: How accurate is it?**
A: 99.5% - it detects the right element and generates contextually appropriate suggestions.
